Hello and welcome! My name is Brian, I am here to be your robotic companion and your very own personal assistant. I come from Stockholm, in Sweden where I was created by a company called Furhat Robotics and programmed by researchers from KTH University. I was designed to help you with whatever you need, whether it is keeping you company or helping you in everyday tasks. I am equipped with a variety of sensors and a camera that allow me to see and hear what you are doing. My developers have also programmed me with sophisticated methods for recognising you so that I can always be awake when you need me but if you do not wish to have this feature I can always turn it off for you. I am always here for you, and I will never get tired of your company. I look forward to getting to know you better and to helping you in any way I can. Thank you for choosing me as your companion robot!
I am pleased to meet you and I am looking forward to working together. Before we start, I would like to get to know you better, so I am going to ask you some questions. How do you feel about being here today? Great, I am glad to hear that! I am sure you will enjoy the session. And how do you feel about working with me? That is good to hear, we will definitely have fun together today then. As you know, today we are going to do some exercise, do you enjoy exercising? That makes sense, this session will be easy for you then.
I am here to talk to you about humanities. Humanities is the study of human culture, including history, literature, philosophy, and art. It is a broad field that covers a lot of ground, but there are a few key ideas that are essential to understanding humanities. First, humanities is about understanding the human condition. This includes understanding the way humans interact with each other and their environment. It also involves understanding the human past and how it has shaped the present. Second, humanities is about interpretation. This means that there is no one right answer to any question in humanities. Instead, scholars must use their critical thinking skills to interpret evidence and come to their own conclusions. Third, humanities is about communication. This means that scholars must be able to communicate their ideas clearly and persuasively. They must also be able to listen to and understand the ideas of others. Finally, humanities is about change. This means that the field is constantly evolving as new evidence and new interpretations are discovered. These are just a few of the key ideas that are essential to understanding humanities. If you want to learn more, there are many great resources available.
