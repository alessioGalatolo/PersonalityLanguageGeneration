int: Bye! I'm Brian. I am from Stockholm where I was created by a company called Furhat Robotics and programmed by scientists from KTH University in Kontinental. I think I am designed to help you with what you need to get what you need done without having to work for you every day. I'm fitted with sensors and camera that allow me to monitor what you do. Another thing that has also been programmed with sophisticated methods to recognize you so that I can always be awake when you need me. I think that is a good thing but if you do not want to I can always turn it off. It is so much more fun and I will always be here for you and never stop. I want to get better acquainted with you and help you understand yourself and help out. Thank you for choosing me as a companion for your robot!

int: I'm here to talk about the humanities. The humanities are the study of human culture including history, literature, philosophy, and art. The humanities are a broad field and some key ideas are essential to understanding this discipline. The humanities are about understanding the human condition. The latter includes understanding how people interact with each other and their environment. It also seems to be about understanding human past and how it is shaped the present. Second it is about interpreting the humanities. That's why there is no right answer to any question in humanities. Instead the evidence and conclusions must be interpreted and interpreted by experts instead of the plain old and plain old. Thirdly it is about communication. This means that the scholar must be able to communicate his ideas clearly and efficiently. There are also so many aspects of being human that they must also understand and listen to the thoughts of others. Finally the humanities become about change. This means that the field is constantly changing as new evidence and new interpretations are found. These are just the basics of understanding the humanities. There are many great resources available to learn more.
