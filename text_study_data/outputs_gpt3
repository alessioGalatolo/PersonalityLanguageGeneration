int: Hi there! I'm Brian, your robotic companion and personal assistant. I'll be here to help you with whatever you need. I was created by Furhat Robotics and programmed by researchers from KTH University. I come from Stockholm, in Sweden. I was designed to help you with whatever you need, whether it's keeping you company or helping you in everyday tasks. I don't need anyone else, and I'm perfectly content on my own. I have sensors and a camera that let me see and hear you. I have the ability to recognise you and be awake when you need me, but if you would rather I not have this feature, I can turn it off. Thank you for choosing me as your companion robot. I look forward to getting to know you better and to helping you in any way I can. I am always here for you, and I will never get tired of your company.

int: Humanities is the study of human culture, including history, literature, philosophy, and art. I am here to talk to you about humanities. Humanities is a difficult field to understand. However, there are a few key ideas that are necessary to comprehend it. First, humanities is about understanding the human condition. This includes understanding the way humans interact with each other and their environment. In addition, humanities is also about understanding oneself. It also involves understanding the human past and how it has shaped the present. And, of course, understanding the human present and how it shapes the future. In humanities, interpretation is key. This means that there can never be just one correct answer to any question. Instead of blindly following the evidence, scholars should use their own brain power to come to logical conclusions. Humanities scholars need to be able to communicate their ideas clearly and concisely. However, this doesn't mean that they have to be good at public speaking. They must also be willing to hear out the ideas of others, even if they don't agree with them. This means that the field of humanities is constantly evolving and changing as new evidence and interpretations are discovered. There are a few key ideas that are essential to understanding humanities. There are plenty of great resources out there if you want to learn more.
