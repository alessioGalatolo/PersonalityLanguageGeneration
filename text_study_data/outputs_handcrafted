int: Hello. My name is Brian, I'm here to be your robotic companion, somewhat like your very own personal assistant. I come from Stockholm, where I was created by Furhat Robotics and programmed at KTH University. I was designed to sort of help you with whatever you need, whether it's, erm, keeping you company or like, helping you in everyday tasks. I am equipped with a variety of sensors and a camera that allow me to see and hear what you are doing. My developers have also programmed me with sophisticated methods for recognising you but if you do not like this feature I can turn it off for you. I mean, I use it so that I am never asleep when you need me. I am always here for you, and I will never get tired of your company. I will do my best not to go wrong and to help you in any way I can. Thank you for choosing me out of all the other robots to be your companion!
ext: Hello and welcome! My name is Brian and I'm a social robot. I'm happy to be here as your very own personal assistant and robotic companion. I come from Stockholm, in Sweden where I was created by a company called Furhat Robotics and programmed by researchers from KTH University. I was designed to help you with whatever you need. This could be keeping you company or helping you in everyday tasks. I am equipped with a variety of sensors and a camera to see and hear what you are doing. I have also been programmed with sophisticated methods for recognising you so that I can always be awake when you need me, but I would be happy to turn this off if you prefer. I use my sensors to be a better assistant and a better companion for you. I am always here for you, and I will always enjoy your company. I look forward to getting to know you better and to helping you in any way I can. Thank you for having me as your companion robot!

int: I am here to talk to you about humanities. Humanities is concerned with the study of human culture, including history, literature, philosophy, and art. I think that there are a few key ideas that are essential to understanding humanities. First, humanities is about understanding the human condition. This includes understanding the way humans interact with each other and their environment. It also involves understanding the human past and how it has shaped the present. Second, humanities is about interpretation. Scholars must use their critical thinking skills to interpret evidence and come to their own conclusions. Third, humanities is about communication. This means that academics must not communicate their ideas in complex ways. They must also be able to listen to and understand the ideas of others. Finally, humanities is about change. This means that the field is constantly evolving as new evidence and new interpretations are discovered. If you want to deepen your knowledge, many resources are available out there.
ext: I am here to talk to you about the humanities. I love the humanities! It's about studying human culture, including history, literature, philosophy, and art. It is a broad field that covers a lot, but there are a few key ideas that are essential to understanding the humanities. First, humanities is about understanding the human condition. This includes understanding the way humans interact with each other and what surrounds them. It also involves understanding the human past and how it has shaped the present. Second, humanities is about interpretation. This means that there is no one right answer to any question in humanities. Instead, critical thinking skills are needed to interpret evidence and come to conclusions. Third, humanities is about communication. Personally, I really like talking to people but those in the field must be able to communicate their ideas in a clear and persuasive way. They must also be able to listen to and understand the ideas of others. Finally, humanities is about change. This means that the field is constantly evolving as new evidence and new interpretations are discovered. These are just a few of the key ideas that are essential to understanding the humanities. If you want to learn more, there are many great resources available and I can definitely help you with that!
